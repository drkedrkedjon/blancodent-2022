The duration of the treatment does not depend on the technique or type of braces, but on biological factors, the body's response and the complexity of the case."

          <h3 class="fs-600 ff-semi mayuscula">What is orthodontics?</h3>
          <p>
            It is the specialty whose objective is to balance and achieve
            harmony in the masticatory system, both in children and adults, so
            it is never too late to start this treatment. It is the set of
            movements of the teeth to improve their function, aesthetics and
            bite.
          </p>

          <p>
            With orthodontics, the ideal position is sought between all teeth in
            relation to the jaws and the joint that joins them with the base of
            the skull. In addition, it ensures a good bite function taking into
            account the anatomical differences of each patient.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is important to bear in mind that orthodontics is much more than
            an aesthetic solution, more than a simple alignment of the teeth.
            The healthy life of the teeth, gums and jaw joint is achieved, thus
            providing the well-being of your mouth.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first step is to do an orthodontic study to obtain the diagnosis
            and plan the necessary treatment.
          </p>

          <h3 class="fs-600 ff-semi mayuscula">
            How do i know if i need orthodontics?
          </h3>

          <p>
            The need for treatment is different for each person. Each case is
            very individual and personalized, no two cases are the same. The
            purpose is to bring the teeth into their ideal position so that they
            bite properly. By balancing the contacts, they tend to last healthy
            for many years.
          </p>

          <h3 class="fs-600 ff-semi mayuscula">
            Main reasons for orthodontics treatment:
          </h3>

          <h4 class="ff-semi">Get or keep space::</h4>

          <p>
            When baby teeth are changed, there may be a lack of space for
            permanent teeth. Orthodontic appliances are used to maintain or
            create the space necessary for permanent teeth to grow in place.
          </p>

          <h4 class="ff-semi">Crowding:</h4>

          <p>
            To align crooked, crowded teeth, improving the appearance of your
            smile and avoiding problems caused by poor hygiene. Properly aligned
            teeth work better, clean better, and don't wear out unnecessarily.
            Caries development is prevented by crowding caused by poor hygiene.
            Between the crowded teeth there is a perfect space for bacteria and
            plaque difficult to remove with daily hygiene, the main cause of
            cavities and tooth loss.
          </p>

          <h4 class="ff-semi">A good bite needs its ideal position:</h4>

          <p>
            The bite in a bad position causes the wear of the teeth and their
            subsequent loosening. The deterioration of the jaw bones and joints
            develops with consequences such as migraines, noise in the ears,
            pain in the neck, vertigo, etc.
          </p>

          <h3 class="fs-600 ff-semi mayuscula">
            The most common bite problems are:
          </h3>

          <h4 class="ff-semi">Cross bite:</h4>

          <p>
            One or more upper teeth close behind or outside the lower teeth.
          </p>

          <h4 class="ff-semi">Openbite:</h4>

          <p>
            When there is a space between the upper and lower anterior teeth
            because they do not close between them, but between the back teeth.
          </p>

          <h4 class="ff-semi">Overbite or augmented bite:</h4>

          <p>
            The upper teeth completely cover the lower teeth when the bite is
            closed.
          </p>

          <h4 class="ff-semi">The deviated midline:</h4>

          <p>
            The center between the upper teeth does not coincide with the center
            or midline of the lower teeth.
          </p>

          <h4 class="ff-semi">Gum retraction:</h4>

          <p>
            Due to the poor positioning of the teeth, they receive excessive and
            harmful force, causing the gums to retract and ultimately loosen.
            Teeth wear out faster and life is dramatically shorter. Many people
            lose their teeth from overuse.
          </p>

          <h4 class="ff-semi">Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) problems:</h4>

          <p>
            It is the joint that joins two jaws with the base of the skull. When
            our teeth are in a bad position, they bite badly and this causes the
            degenerative processes of the TMJ. The muscles work forcibly to try
            to stabilize the joint causing muscle, neck and ear pain, and also
            migraines.
          </p>

          <h3 class="fs-600 ff-semi mayuscula">Types of orthodontic:</h3>

          <h4 class="ff-semi">Interceptive orthodontics, in children:</h4>

          <p>
            It is orthodontics that, as its name suggests, intercepts the
            problem before it occurs. It is performed with fixed and removable
            appliances that help maintain the space between the teeth by acting
            on the bones that support the teeth. The appliances gradually expand
            the jaws bringing them to the desired position, preventing crowding
            and other future permanent tooth problems.
          </p>

          <h4 class="ff-semi">Corrective orthodontics:</h4>

          <p>
            For both young people and adults, it serves to correct problems of
            functionality and aesthetics. The choice of the orthodontic system
            is made together with the professional depending on each case.
          </p>

          <h3 class="fs-600 ff-semi mayuscula">The most used systems are:</h3>
          <h4 class="ff-semi">Fixed orthodontics with Brackets:</h4>

          <p>The brackets are placed on the outer face of the tooth.</p>

          <p>
            There is also another more aesthetic form of braces that is placed
            on the inside of the teeth. Both systems work in the same way, by
            changing the thickness of the wire, the necessary force is achieved
            to bring the teeth to the desired site.
          </p>

          <p>
            Brackets placed on the outer face are one of the techniques most
            chosen for their simplicity, speed and good value for money.
          </p>

          <h4 class="ff-semi">Orthodontics with alienators:</h4>

          <p>
            It is a treatment with splints or transparent alienants, made of
            plastic, that as they are changed, they alter the position of the
            teeth, placing them in the desired position. The splints are changed
            every 7-15 days for a new set so that the teeth move into their
            optimal position. They are completely personalized, imperceptible
            and very comfortable.
          </p>

          <p>
            Both the number of sets required and the duration of treatment will
            depend on the complexity of the case. The duration of treatment is
            also proportional to the complexity.
          </p>

          <h3 class="fs-600 ff-semi mayuscula">
            What will be the duration of my orthodontics?
          </h3>

          <p>
            Each case is different and may vary, but as a general rule we can
            estimate that the case will usually be resolved in between one and
            two years.
          </p>

          <p>The last phase is very important and is done with retainers.</p>

          <p>
            Once the orthodontic treatment is finished, retainers are
            manufactured so that the teeth do not return to their previous
            position. If this phase is underestimated, the teeth may eventually
            move and return to their previous position. To prevent this from
            happening, the upper and lower transparent splints are delivered (to
            wear at night) or if your case requires, a fixed retainer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus the result obtained with the orthodontic treatment will be
            maintained forever.
